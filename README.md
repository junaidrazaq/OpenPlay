# Hey! Welcome to my completed tech test

## Dependencies used:
- @reduxjs/toolkit
- react-redux
- styled-components
- fuse.js
- @types/styled-components

## Folder Structure

src 
 - components 
    - app
    - shared
 - models
    - [Files_here]
 - redux
    - slices  
    - index.ts

### Benefits
- Seperated redux state from components for ease of access
- Created global types for continuous reuse
- Contained Components to single folder, Whereby further segregated by app components and resuable/common/shared components


## Highlights

- Api request mocked
- Data stored in state, and used accross application
- Fuzzy search implemented using fuse.js
- Reusable component created, used throughout application
- Application made responsive


## Improvements [with increased time]

- Implement filter by dropdown
- Make it clearer that the facilities are clickable
- Increase Styling & further responsiveness of application
- Implement thorough testing
- Write Docs
